## TIC TAC TOE

[ai x and o.webm](https://github.com/Tobshub/tic-tac-toe/assets/108701007/404919fc-3c92-4319-afcc-a86bc31e9beb)

A simple tic-tac-toe (AKA X and O) game where your "O" is always played by an AI.

I made things significantly harder for myself by making the game board a dynamically sized grid, instead of the traditional fixed 3x3. Therefore I couldn't hard code most of the logic :p

Needless to say, this doesn't use an *actual* AI, it uses a basic min-max algorithm - nothing too fancy. Nevertheless, it was super fun to make :D
